## Previously

I was in charge of the digital strategy of VRT NWS, the public news service of Belgium. Here I learned to define a multi channel strategy, taking into account all stakeholders: from the CEO to the journalist that  needs to do the actual heavy lifting.

As Innovation Manager for VRT (where I worked on projects partnering with Google DNI, VUB, iMinds, and many others), I learned to prototype, and used design methodologies for the first time (but certainly not the last).

I produced a live radio show on the national Belgian radio “Studio Brussel”. Working closely with a real audience, learned me the value of live feedback. Also: Hit me up if you need help with your podcast ;)

## Fullstack-ish developer

I code websites and online tools, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and implementing UX best practices.

My preferred  framework is VueJS, but I’ve also created products with NodeJS, ThreeJS, P5.js and Laravel. At the moment I’m doing a deep dive into Go.

I love to test out new, old or unusual CMS systems, or roll my own. At this time, I prefer Statamic for bigger sites, and Netlify CMS for small setups. This website is actually created with Trello as a CMS and Gridsome as Static Site Generator.

*The year was 1998, and CSS 2.0 just became a thing. I created my first website for the local division of the Red Cross and I was hooked. Since then, I’ve seen the explosion of Wordpress sites, created a bunch web apps, got interested in Static Site Generators and started to experiment with no-code tools like Zapier, Webflow and others.*

## To teach is to learn twice

At Erasmus Brussels University of Applied Sciences and Arts, I give an introductionary course into Functional Programming, mainly trying to explain to starting coders that everyting is a paradigm, and they can shift that paradigm in any way they see fit.

At Sint Lukas School Of Arts, I try to get young artists excited about the possibilities of creative coding and generative art. Last year we made a website together, a kind of link aggregator for the work of the students. It was made with ThreeJS, and the drawings of the talented people at Sint Lukas.
