          <h2>The brief</h2>
          <p>When taking their students on excursion, the primary and secondary schools in the city of Brussels regularly have a shortage of bikes. This makes organizing an outing cumbersome. Not all city kids have bikes, because they are too expensive, or because they get stolen too often, etc.</p>

              </a></button>, an organization who promotes biking in the city arranged a container full of bikes to be made available for the schools of Saint-Gilles, one of the communes of Brussels. At the same time, another commune also had the same problems, and a comparable solution. Teachers could reserve bikes for one or more days, pick them up, and return them themselves. They called it "Velotheek" (which translates to "bike library").</p>
          <p>But both communes realized quickly that the reservations of the <button
              id="testId"
              class="underline"
              @mouseover="infoId = 'testId'"
            >bikes would become complicated</button> and time consuming for the people in charge. So they turned to me to come up with a more streamlined process.</p>

          <div class="italic leading-0 m-0"><span class="font-semibold">Duration:</span> 2 weeks</div>
          <p>I visited both Velotheek locations, and talked with all the people involved. Although the premise is comparable at the different communes, there were a lot of differences in the booking flow. The two biggest differences were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At Velotheek 1, a padlock opened the door of the Velotheek, and could be opened by anyone who had the access code. At Velotheek 2, they used a key, so the user had to check in with someone from the organisation to open up the Velotheek.</li>
            <li>In Velotheek 1, you could only book bikes for one day, not multiple days. At Velotheek 2, multiple days were possible, but not more than 10.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These two differences seemed to have a big impact on the flow of the application, and how the user would interact with it. To map out all the different user flows, I started working on personaâ€™s and corresponding jobs to be done.</p>
          <p>After the research I defined these persona's:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The teacher</li>
            <li>The responsible for administration in the school</li>
            <li>The Bike Fixer (someone of Pro Velo)</li>
            <li>The Administrator (someone of the commune)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every "persona" gets it's own "jobs to be done", mapping of needs and potential risks involved. From that list I defined what jobs we needed to tackle in the first iteration of the project. In this phase I also performed desk research, looking into existing applications, or comparable sharing platforms.

          <p>I don't actually know what this exercise is called, but either way, it's a very helpful one. I map out all the steps a user needs to take to get the job done. Every screen has three sections: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The module: This is not really necessary, but already sets up how I will think about the app when I start coding. It helps to build the app in my mind palace.</li>
            <li>The view: What the user will see.</li>
            <li>The actions: What the user can do on this page.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This very low fidelity prototype gets shared with the the smallest group of stakeholders (in this case just the product owners and one teacher). It's not a real usability test, but will quickly uncover missing basic features or steps in the flow.</p>
